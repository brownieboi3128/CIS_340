    "##### Jupyter notebooks are an alternative environment for developing and running code, as well as for integrating documentation and graphical results. The IPython interpreter, is running inside a Jupyter notebook, and can process both Python code and IPython %magic functions that you enter into the input cells. Jupyter notebooks introduce a new level of code structure, that of cells, and the IPython interpreter is running within each of those code cells. You can group multiple Python expressions together in a cell, and those expression only get evaluated once you execute the entire cell. In Jupyter notebooks, a simple carriage return (return key on keyboard) will move you down to a new line in the same cell, but in order to execute the cell, you must type Shift+Return, i.e., the Shift and Return keys at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### At any given time, one cell is active and awaiting input. The cell that is currently awaiting input is highlighted by a surrounding box and colored bar on the left edge. You can switch between different cells just by clicking the mouse in the one you'd like to work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Each cell has a *type* associated with it, which can be either *Code* or *Markdown*. The *Code* type is for Python code, and the *Markdown* type is for text."
