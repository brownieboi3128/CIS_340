This can lead to confusion because you need to keep track in your mind how temperature is labeled in each column name (T, Temp, Temperature).  Furthermore, the largest temperature is labeled with the shorthand \"Max\", while the smallest temperature is labeled with the full word \"Minimum\".  While we are free to choose whatever names we want for our data (within any syntactic rules), it is useful &mdash; for both you the developer and for anyone else who might be using the code &mdash; to establish some uniformity and consistency in naming.  Fortunately, we don't need to go back and modify the original csv file; we can just modify the column names in our code.\n",
